# Site event Halloween first mobile

This was my first site. I put everything I learned in classes and books into practice. Not only the programming classes, but also marketing, design and even advertising.

## Ux and UI
Everything that can be used in this site was made by me. Until this moment, my skills with JavaScript are not the best yet, so I always studied as much as possible to be able to surprise within what I know.
The UX/UI of the page was developed by me using Figma and Adobe Illustrator.
All Css and HTML of the page was also made from scratch.

## First mobile
I prioritized the site to be designed first for mobile, then for other screen formats. Mainly because of the public study that was done. But, the whole process of the site was developed so that any platform could use the site without major problems. 

## Prototype coming out of the paper
It was very funny to see the site online, because it was 90% beautiful, but when it went live it got all twisted, and that's part of it. I made the corrections that made it flawless. 

## My new super power
I still have a lot to learn. Mostly in JavaScript or some other language, but I'm proud that I was able to make something so cool.
The users of the site gave me great feedback on everything I did, and that is just too good. I have to keep the site updated, adding new stuff and all that. It's just as I imagined it would be. 
Programming really is a super power.
